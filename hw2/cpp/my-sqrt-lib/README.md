So I tried to follow the tutorials from here:

    https://koistya.medium.com/how-to-call-c-c-code-from-node-js-86a773033892
    https://medium.com/jspoint/a-simple-guide-to-load-c-c-code-into-node-js-javascript-applications-3fcccf54fd32

but when I wanted to run "node-gyp configure" I kept getting a lot of error like:

    Error: Cannot find module 'nopt'
    Error: Cannot find module 'graceful-fs'

I tried to install all the dependencies, but the errors are still there. After 2 hours I gave up. 
I don't know if the problem is from npm or I just missed a step along the way.
